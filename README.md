# Tye Explorer for Visual Studio

I just really wanted to easily attach a debugger to a service run by Tye. So here's a quick and simple Visual Studio extension to do so.

Might add support for logging later.

## How to use
Open the explorer through `View -> Other Windows -> Tye Explorer`, refresh the list (with Tye running) and right click on any replica to attach to the process.
